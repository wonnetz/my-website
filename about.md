Thanks for stopping by and checking things out! Here is a little information about me.  

I'm currently transitioning from a being a first year Doctoral student in Applied Mathematics at Georgia State University to a full-time career in either the Analytics field or the Consulting field. I have experience on many different personal projects that you will be able to find on the home page.  

In my free time, I enjoy reading novels, jamming out to some music, and watching movies. Here's a quote from a short story written by one of my favorite authors! 

> _"I imagined it infinite, no longer composed of octagonal kiosks and returning paths, but of rivers and provinces and kingdoms... I thought of a labyrinth of labyrinths, of one sinuous spreading labyrinth that would encompass the past and the future and in some way involve the stars."_
> 
> _Jorge Luis Borges, The Garden of Forking Paths_
