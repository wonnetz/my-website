# About Me

It seems that you've found my website and you're looking through the About page. This is the first website I have ever built, so if you have any comments or suggestions, then please let me know. I made this website as a fun side project so who knows where it'll go from here.

Thanks for stopping by and checking things out! 

I've spent a lot of time looking into Big Data and the cutting edge tools that are used on it. I'm quite familiar with ingesting large amounts of data through Sqoop or Flume, storing data in HDFS or in the cloud, and also using analytical tools like Hadoop MapReduce or Spark. There's lots of Data out there so it's lots of fun to really get your hands in there to transform it into a more accessible format.

When I'm not looking at Big Data tools or concteps, I enjoy reading novels, jamming out to some music, and watching movies. As a thank you gift for getting this far, please accept this quote from a short story written by one of my favorite authors!
